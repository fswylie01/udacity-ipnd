<h4>Project 3: Intro to Python - Rock, Paper, Scissors</h4>
<p>For this project, I was able to apply my Python and object-oriented programming skills to build a program/game (Rock Paper Scissors). The program has classes that represent the game and its players. The players have different strategies, as well as a human player class that lets a human play the game against the computer.<p>
